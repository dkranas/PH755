    "## Logistic map\n",

    "x' = r\\, x\\, (1. - x).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is an iterative map. If you choose a value of $r$ and a starting value of $x$ and iterate the above  equation a lot of times, one of the following things will happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The value of $x$ will quickly approach a fixed point and remain there.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The value of $x$ settles to a set of values, say four, repeating them in a given order over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It takes a seemingly random sequence of values. This is known as deterministic chaos. It is called so because even though it seems chaotic, the sequence can be predicted using logistic map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to compute the behaviour of logistic map. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a value of $r$ and choose $x = 0.5$. Iterate the equation for say 1000 times. This will allow the value of $x$ to settle down to any of the three possibilities. Now iterate the equation for 1000 more values. Plot these 1000 points as black dots on a graph with r value on the x-axis and $x$ value on y-axis. Repeat this exercise for $r$ in the range $[1.,4.]$ in steps of $0.01$ and plot them on the same graph. The plot you obtain is known as Feigenbaum plot.\n",
